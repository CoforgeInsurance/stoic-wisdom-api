## Architecture

### Technology Choices

- **Axum**: High-performance async web framework built on Tokio
- **SQLite**: Lightweight, serverless database perfect for read-heavy workloads
- **sqlx**: Compile-time checked SQL queries for type safety
- **Tower**: Middleware for CORS and tracing

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Async/Await**: Non-blocking I/O for high concurrency
2. **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
3. **Compile-Time Checks**: SQL queries validated at compile time
4. **Release Optimizations**: LTO, single codegen unit, stripped binaries
5. **Multi-Stage Docker**: Minimal runtime image (~45MB)

### Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless API design allows multiple instances
- **Read Replicas**: SQLite supports read replicas for higher load
- **Caching**: Easy to add Redis/Memcached for frequently accessed data
- **CDN**: Static responses can be cached at edge locations

## Content Quality

### Quotes (75 total)
- 25 from Marcus Aurelius
- 25 from Seneca
- 25 from Epictetus
- All with sources, context, and modern interpretations

### Themes (7 core principles)
1. Dichotomy of Control
2. Negative Visualization
3. Virtue as the Sole Good
4. Amor Fati
5. Memento Mori
6. Cosmopolitanism
7. Present Moment Focus

Each theme includes scientific connections to CBT, neuroscience, and psychology.

### Historical Content
- 24 timeline events from 300 BCE to 2015 CE
- 15 incidents with lessons and modern relevance
- Rich biographical content for all three philosophers

## Testing Evidence

Run tests to verify implementation:

```bash
# Run tests and save output
cargo test 2>&1 | tee test-results.txt

# Test specific functionality
cargo test test_philosophers_seeded
cargo test test_quotes_seeded
cargo test test_themes_seeded
```

All tests verify:
- Database schema creation
- Data seeding (philosophers, quotes, themes, timeline, incidents)
- Data integrity and counts
