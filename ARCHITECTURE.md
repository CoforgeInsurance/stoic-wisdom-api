# System Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the Stoic Wisdom API, emphasizing high performance and scalability.

## Technology Choices
- **Axum**: A high-performance web framework for Rust.
- **Tokio**: Asynchronous runtime for handling concurrent requests.
- **SQLite/sqlx**: Lightweight database for storing quotes and philosopher information.

## Performance Optimization Strategies
- Use of async programming to handle multiple requests efficiently.
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data.

## Docker Multi-Stage Build Approach
- First stage: Build the Rust application with all dependencies.
- Second stage: Create a minimal image with only the necessary runtime files.

## Azure Deployment Architecture
- Utilize Azure Container Instances (ACI) and Azure Container Registry (ACR).

## Scalability Considerations
- Design the API to handle increased load by scaling horizontally.
