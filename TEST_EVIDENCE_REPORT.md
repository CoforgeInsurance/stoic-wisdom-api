- `themes.feature` - 2 scenarios
- `performance.feature` - 3 scenarios

**Total Scenarios:** 17

## Performance Benchmarks

### Backend API Performance

**Script:** `scripts/benchmark.sh`  
**Status:** ✅ Ready  
**Target:** < 50ms response time per endpoint

#### Endpoints to Benchmark

1. Health Check - `/health`
2. List Philosophers - `/philosophers`
3. Get Philosopher - `/philosophers/:id`
4. Philosopher with Quotes - `/philosophers/:id/quotes`
5. List All Quotes - `/quotes`
6. Random Quote - `/quotes/random`
7. Daily Quote - `/quotes/daily`
8. Filter by Theme - `/quotes?theme=...`
9. Filter by Philosopher - `/quotes?philosopher=...`
10. Search Quotes - `/quotes?search=...`
11. List Themes - `/themes`
12. Get Theme - `/themes/:id`
13. Get Timeline - `/timeline`
14. List Incidents - `/incidents`
