### Philosophers Endpoint
Total philosophers:
3

Sample philosopher:
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Marcus Aurelius",
  "era": "Roman Empire",
  "birth_year": 121,
  "death_year": 180,
  "biography": "Marcus Aurelius was Roman Emperor from 161 to 180 CE and is considered one of the most important Stoic philosophers. Born into a prominent Roman family, he received an excellent education and was adopted by Emperor Antoninus Pius. As emperor, he faced numerous challenges including wars, plague, and political turmoil, yet maintained his philosophical principles throughout. His personal journal, \"Meditations,\" written during military campaigns, reveals a man constantly striving for self-improvement and virtue. Unlike other philosophers who taught from ivory towers, Marcus practiced Stoicism while bearing the weight of an empire. He believed in the interconnectedness of all things and the importance of accepting what cannot be changed while taking action on what can. His reign is often considered the end of the Pax Romana and the beginning of Rome's decline, yet his philosophical legacy has endured for nearly two millennia.",
  "key_works": "Meditations (Ta eis heauton)",
  "core_teachings": "Focus on what you can control; Accept fate with equanimity; Practice virtue in all circumstances; Recognize the impermanence of all things; Serve the common good; Maintain inner tranquility amid external chaos"
}

### Quotes Endpoint
Total quotes:
75

Daily quote:
{
  "id": 62,
  "philosopher_id": 3,
  "philosopher_name": "Epictetus",
  "text": "People are not disturbed by things, but by the views they take of them.",
  "source": "Enchiridion",
  "context": "Core cognitive principle",
  "modern_interpretation": "Reality is neutral; interpretation creates disturbance. Change your view, change your experience. This is CBT's foundation."
}

### Themes Endpoint
Total themes:
7

Sample theme with scientific connections:
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Dichotomy of Control",
  "description": "The fundamental distinction between what is within our control (our thoughts, judgments, and actions) and what is not (external events, others' actions, outcomes). This principle teaches us to focus our energy only on what we can influence.",
  "principle": "Focus on what you can control, accept what you cannot. Invest your energy wisely.",
  "scientific_connection": "Research in stress psychology shows that perceived control is a key factor in resilience. Studies demonstrate that people who distinguish between controllable and uncontrollable factors show lower cortisol levels and better stress management.",
  "cbt_connection": "CBT's core principle of separating thoughts from events mirrors this Stoic teaching. Cognitive restructuring helps patients identify what they can control (their interpretations) versus what they cannot (external circumstances).",
  "neuroscience_connection": "Neuroscience research shows that the prefrontal cortex activates when we exercise self-control and make deliberate choices. Accepting what we cannot control reduces amygdala activation, lowering anxiety responses.",
  "psychology_connection": "Aligns with locus of control research by Rotter. Internal locus of control (believing you control your responses) correlates with better mental health, higher achievement, and greater life satisfaction."
}

### Timeline Endpoint
Total timeline events:
23

### Incidents Endpoint
Total incidents:

Sample incident:
{
  "id": 1,

  "description": "Zeno of Citium was a wealthy merchant until a shipwreck destroyed his cargo and fortune. Washed up in Athens, he wandered into a bookshop and discovered philosophy. He later said, \"I made a prosperous voyage when I suffered shipwreck.\"",
  "lesson": "Apparent disasters can redirect us to our true calling. Loss of material wealth can lead to spiritual wealth. What seems like failure may be fortune in disguise.",
  "modern_relevance": "Career setbacks, financial losses, or life disruptions often redirect people to more fulfilling paths. Many successful people trace their success to apparent failures that forced new directions."
